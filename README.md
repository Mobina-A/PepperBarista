# PepperBarista

## Overview
This project utilized **Choregraphe 2.5.10.7** to program the humanoid robot **Pepper** in a social robotics scenario where Pepper acted as a waiter. The robot approached tables, presented the menu, and took guest orders. Additionally, we introduced a social dynamic by making Pepper more polite and gentle towards female guests than male guests.

## Implementation
To execute this scenario, we implemented the following Choregraphe blocks:
- **Move To Block**: Enabled Pepper to autonomously navigate to the guests' table.
- **Timeline Block**: Ensured Pepper performed respectful gestures like bowing or nodding.
- **Dialogue Blocks**: Facilitated interactive conversations with guests, adjusting responses based on gender.
- **Show Image Blocks**: Displayed the menu and order confirmations on Pepper's tablet.
- **Switch Case Blocks**: Validated and processed guest orders to provide appropriate responses.

### Social Interaction Design
Pepper's interactions were designed to maximize **perceived intelligence** and **social awareness** by:
- Using polite and complimentary phrases when addressing female guests.
- Maintaining a neutral tone with male guests.
- Navigating the environment autonomously while avoiding obstacles.
- Displaying visual confirmations of orders on the tablet.

## Statistical Analysis
A survey was conducted to evaluate Pepper's performance in its waiter role. The analysis included:
- **Internal Consistency** (Cronbach’s alpha > 0.80) → Indicating high questionnaire reliability.
- **Normality Test** (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 0.8094) → Suggesting normal score distribution.
- **Paired T-Test** (p < 0.05) → Revealing a significant difference between perceptions of Pepper’s human-like qualities and likeability.

### Key Findings
- Participants perceived Pepper positively, with scores clustering in the mid-to-high range.
- Statistical tests confirmed strong reliability and normal distribution of the survey data.
- A significant distinction was observed between **human-like qualities** and **likeability**, suggesting targeted improvements in future iterations.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated Pepper’s capabilities as a social robot waiter and highlighted areas for improvement in **trust-building** and **intelligence demonstration**. By refining its interaction design and adapting behaviors to user expectations, future iterations can further enhance Pepper's perceived intelligence and user experience.
